All in an effort to make a forthcoming for the future. That is why this year I want to make the future happen. By trying to be the best version of myself I plan on reinforcing my research and sharing it openly. Knowledge is meant to be shared with others.</p> <p>If your reading this know that you can do the same. However, you plan on integrating this into your life we can all strive to be better than our former selves. Happy New Year and let the 2026 ride start!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="learning,"/><category term="machine"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting off the New Year Strong.
