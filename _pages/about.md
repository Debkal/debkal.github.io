I am currently studying to be a deep learner. I love to learn and I hope I can make my computer learn too. I am a Senior undergraduate student in Illinois. I am currently experimenting on a Gait Analysis model research. Please check out my research repository for my thoughts on papers I have interpreted. Look out for my first thought piece on modern comprehensive gait analysis research.
