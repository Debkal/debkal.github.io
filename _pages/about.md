I am currently studying to be a deep learner. My computer takes my passion to learn to the next level. I am currently a senior undergraduate student in Illinois. Currently I experiment with Gait Analysis model research. Please check out my projects page for my thoughts on Gait Analysis modeling. Look out for my first thought piece on contemporary gait analysis.

I have a couple hobbies besides deep learning. My favorite is to play with my dog. I love to interact with him and see his quirks expressed. He is mischievous at times but I forgive him for thinking outside of his constraints. I also am into playing chess on my phone. I lose a lot but, I get to learn from my losses. I am a computer enthusiast as I have 3 operating systems at home. Usually I'm pressing my keyboard's buttons on Linux Debian and Linux Fedora. I do have a windows pc for when I want my computer's ram to disappear. You can probably find me on my computer reading papers from <a href="https://www.arxiv.org">Arxiv</a> or outside on my yard's patio.
